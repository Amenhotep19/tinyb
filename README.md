Tiny Bluetooth Library

This project aims to create Bluetooth GATT bindings for C++, Java and other
languages, using BlueZ over DBus. Most of the code is automatically
generated using gdbus-codegen, including a few additions to the default
behaviour, such that it also generates the C++ classes, which wrap the functions
normally generated by gdbus-codegen.
